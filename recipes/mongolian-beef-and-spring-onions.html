    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This Mongolian beef recipe with green onions has a soy-based sauce for a Chinese-style beef dish. Best served
        over soft rice noodles or rice.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 teaspoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon finely chopped garlic</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon grated fresh ginger root</li>
        <li>2/3 cup dark brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 cup water</li>
        <li>1 pound beef flank steak, sliced 1/4 inch thick on the diagonal</li>
        <li>1/4 cup cornstarch</li>
        <li>1 cup vegetable oil for frying</li>
        <li>2 bunches green onions, cut in 2-inch lengths</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Heat 2 teaspoons of vegetable oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add garlic and ginger; cook and stir until
            fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in brown sugar, soy sauce, and water. Increase heat to medium-high; stir
            until sauce boils and slightly thickens, about 4 minutes. Remove sauce from the heat and set aside.</li>
        <li>Place beef into a large bowl; add cornstarch and mix until beef is thoroughly coated. Set aside until most
            of the cornstarch has been absorbed, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Heat vegetable oil in a deep skillet to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Shake excess cornstarch from beef slices and drop into hot oil, a few at a time, stirring briefly and frying
            until edges become crisp, about 2 minutes. Remove beef with a large slotted spoon; drain on paper towels.
        </li>
        <li>Remove excess oil from the skillet, then heat the skillet over medium heat; add beef slices and stir in
            prepared sauce. Add green onions and bring to a boil; cook until the onions have just softened and are
            bright green, about 1 to 2 minutes.</li>

    </ol>
